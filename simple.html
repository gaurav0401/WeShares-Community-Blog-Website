Such is the case with the black comedy thriller, I Care A Lot, where a con woman makes her living by becoming the court-appointed guardian to vulnerable elders, convincing the courts that they’re unable to take care of themselves and seizing their assets. However, she finds herself in dangerous waters after she hijacks guardianship over a crime lord’s mother. The cat-and-mouse chase keeps you on the edge of your seat until the last moments of the film. Rosamund Pike stars as the meticulous yet manipulative con artist, unwilling to give up her enterprise without a fight; in fact, her electric performance won her a Golden Globe. — Meredith Loftus</p>

<p>
  Side Effects was Steven Soderbergh’s last film before he reportedly “retired” from filmmaking, only to return nearly a year later. Soderbergh can be trusted to craft meticulous thrillers, but his collaborations with screenwriter Scott Z. Burns have been a high point; Burns adds a layer of insight into highly specific industries. Following the success of Contagion and The Informant!, Side Effects explores the pharmaceutical industry and the impacts of untested medical research. The tight, intimate thriller features strong work from Rooney Mara in particular, whose character is forced to reckon with the consequences of an experience she can’t even remember. — Liam Gaughan

She has a clear view into the home across the way, which was recently purchased by the Russell family. One night, she witnesses what she believes to be Alistair Russell (Gary Oldman) stabbing his wife Jane (Julianne Moore) to death in the living room. Anna calls the authorities, but has trouble convincing them of what she saw. Will the woman in the window be able to seek justice for her deceased neighbor? — Emily Bernard
